# ESLint Code Quality Report

## Summary

ESLint has been configured and run on the project, identifying 78 issues:
- 20 errors
- 58 warnings

Some issues were automatically fixed, but several require manual attention.

## Issues by Category

### 1. Unused Variables (8 errors)
- `PORT` variable assigned but never used in `src/app.ts`
- Several variables defined but never used in various controllers and middleware

### 2. Type Import Issues (Multiple instances)
- Several files import types but don't use `import type` syntax
- Fixed automatically where possible

### 3. Floating Promises (9 errors)
- Unhandled promises in route handlers that need to be awaited or properly handled
- These represent potential runtime issues that should be addressed

### 4. Console Statements (15 warnings)
- Multiple `console.log` and `console.error` statements throughout the codebase
- These should be replaced with proper logging solutions in production

### 5. Nullish Coalescing Operator (15 warnings)
- Suggestions to use `??` instead of `||` for safer null/undefined handling
- These are best practice improvements

### 6. Non-null Assertions (4 warnings)
- Use of `!` operator in `src/services/storageService.ts`
- This was added to fix TypeScript compilation errors but represents a potential runtime risk

### 7. Any Types (10 warnings)
- Use of `any` type in various places
- These should be replaced with specific types for better type safety

## Manual Fixes Required

### Floating Promises
These need to be properly handled:
- `src/routes/v1/orders.ts` (3 instances)
- `src/routes/v1/products.ts` (3 instances)
- `src/scripts/init-database.ts` (1 instance)

### Unused Variables
These should be removed or properly used:
- `PORT` in `src/app.ts`
- Various variables in controllers and middleware

### Non-null Assertions
Consider safer alternatives to `!` operator in `src/services/storageService.ts`

## Recommendations

1. **Address Floating Promises**: These represent potential runtime issues that should be fixed
2. **Replace Console Statements**: Implement a proper logging solution
3. **Improve Type Safety**: Replace `any` types with specific types
4. **Use Nullish Coalescing**: Replace `||` with `??` where appropriate for safer null handling
5. **Remove Unused Variables**: Clean up unused code
6. **Use Type-only Imports**: Use `import type` for imports used only as types

## Next Steps

1. Address the floating promises by properly awaiting or handling the promises
2. Replace console statements with a proper logging library
3. Improve type safety by replacing `any` with specific types
4. Consider using environment variable validation instead of non-null assertions
