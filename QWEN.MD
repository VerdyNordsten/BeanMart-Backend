# Agent Code - Task List and Improvements

## Fix Issue
**COMPLETED** - Created a middleware to check if the token belongs to the user themselves, preventing users from CRUD operations on addresses belonging to other users.

### Implementation Details:
1. Created a new middleware `checkAddressOwnership` in `src/middleware/ownership.ts`
2. The middleware validates that the authenticated user owns the address they're trying to access
3. Integrated the middleware into the user addresses routes that require ownership validation:
   - GET /user-addresses/:id
   - PUT /user-addresses/:id
   - DELETE /user-addresses/:id
   - POST /user-addresses/:id/set-default
4. Removed duplicate ownership validation from controller methods since it's now handled by the middleware
5. The middleware provides centralized ownership validation that can be reused across routes

### Benefits:
- Centralized ownership validation logic
- Consistent security checks across all address-related operations
- Reduced code duplication in controllers
- Easier to maintain and update security logic

## Code Optimization
**COMPLETED** - Optimized middleware code for better performance and maintainability.

### Implementation Details:
1. Removed unused `strictAuth.ts` middleware
2. Simplified authentication middleware by removing unnecessary logging
3. Improved error handling in all middleware files
4. Made code more efficient and easier to read

### Benefits:
- Reduced codebase size by removing unused files
- Improved performance by removing unnecessary logging
- Better error handling across all middleware
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Simplified General Ownership Middleware
**COMPLETED** - Created a single, simple, and reusable ownership middleware that can be used for all routes.

### Implementation Details:
1. Created a single `checkOwnership` factory function in `src/middleware/ownership.ts`
2. This function can create ownership middleware for any entity with a user_id field
3. Updated user address routes to use the new simplified middleware
4. Updated order routes to use the new simplified middleware
5. Removed all the overly complex middleware files

### Benefits:
- Single, simple middleware that can be used for all entity types
- Easy to use: just call `checkOwnership(model, idParamName, userIdField)`
- No more complex inheritance or factory patterns
- Reduced codebase complexity
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Usage Examples:
```typescript
// For user addresses
const checkAddressOwnership = checkOwnership(userAddressModel);

// For orders
const checkOrderOwnership = checkOwnership(orderModel);

// For custom entities with different field names
const checkCustomOwnership = checkOwnership(customModel, 'customId', 'owner_id');
```

### Development Commands
- Never run `pnpm run dev` directly
- Use the proper development workflow as specified in the project documentation
