# API Testing Results and Issues

## Overview
Tested all API endpoints in the Swagger UI with dummy data. All endpoints are now functional and working correctly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Management Issues
- **Create User**: Fixed - The `full_name` field is now properly saved when creating a user.
- **Update User**: Fixed - Database errors when updating a user have been resolved.

### 2. Product Management Issues
- **Create Product**: Fixed - The `short_description` and `long_description` fields are now properly saved when creating a product.
- **Update Product**: Fixed - Database errors when updating a product have been resolved.

### 3. Product Variant Issues
- **Update Product Variant**: Fixed - Database errors when updating a product variant have been resolved.

### 4. Category Issues
- **Update Category**: Fixed - Database errors when updating a category have been resolved.

### 5. User Address Issues
- **Update User Address**: Fixed - Database errors when updating a user address have been resolved.

### 6. Order Management Issues
- **Create Order**: Fixed - The validation schema now properly handles optional `orderNumber` and `totalAmount` fields, allowing the controller to auto-generate these values.

## Field Name Mapping Issues
All field name mapping issues have been resolved. The API now consistently uses snake_case for both requests and responses, matching the database schema.

## Summary
All the issues documented in the previous testing session have been successfully fixed. The API is now fully functional with all endpoints working correctly.

## Note
Products that were created before the fixes will still show null values for description fields if they were originally created with null values. This is expected behavior as the fix only affects how new products are created and how existing products are retrieved, not the data that was already stored in the database.
